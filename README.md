# Tasks

A collection of my routine [**Taskfiles**](https://taskfile.dev) that I often use with my macOS laptop.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install `task` from the link above.
3. Create a symbolic link from the main `Taskfile.yml` to your home directory.

```bash
ln -sf Taskfile.yml ~/Taskfile.yml
```

4. Test the tasks are working by running `task -g -a`.
